# doc2vec 

This repository contains an R package allowing to build a `Paragraph Vector` models also known as doc2vec

- It is based on the paper *Distributed Representations of Sentences and Documents* [[Mikolov et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4053.pdf)]
- This R package is an Rcpp wrapper around https://github.com/hiyijian/doc2vec
- The package allows one 
    - to train paragraph embeddings (also known as document embeddings) on character data or data in a text file
    - use the embeddings to find similar paragraph or documents
- Note. For getting word vectors in R: look at package https://github.com/bnosac/word2vec

Package is under construction and might be incorporated later on in https://github.com/bnosac/word2vec - use at your own risk.
